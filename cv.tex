% About Me Section
\section{About Me}
I am a motivated and research-oriented undergraduate student at IISER Pune, with a strong academic background and a deep passion for Number Theory, Graph Theory, and Spectral Analysis. My fascination with Number Theory arose from exploring numerical patterns and their surprising connections to various fields. Through research internships and academic projects, I have honed my analytical and problem-solving skills, further fueling my interest in advanced mathematical research. I have also explored algebraic graph theory, broadening my interests in this field. I am eager to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree to deepen my expertise and contribute to innovative research.
